<b>Object Tracking in Traffic Videos<b/>

<body>This project demonstrates real-time object tracking in traffic videos using a combination of the YOLOv8 object detection model and the DeepSORT tracking algorithm. The system can detect and track multiple vehicles in a video, assigning each one a unique ID and maintaining their identities across frames. Additionally, the bounding box coordinates and class information are logged in a CSV file for further analysis.<body/>
